# Superstore Power BI Sales Analysis

This project showcases a business intelligence dashboard developed using Power BI to analyze and visualize sales performance for a fictional Superstore. The dataset contains detailed information on orders, including customer segments, regional distribution, product categories, and sales metrics.

The primary objective of this project is to extract actionable insights that can help businesses optimize performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions. By transforming raw data into an interactive dashboard, this project demonstrates how Power BI can be used to simplify complex datasets and drive strategic planning.

Project Overview

The dataset simulates sales transactions made across multiple regions and product categories. Each record includes order date, category, quantity, sales amount, profit, shipping details, and customer demographics. Using this data, an end-to-end BI solution was developed that tracks key business performance indicators in real-time.

* Interactive slicers for dynamic filtering based on user selection
* Monthly and yearly sales trend charts to observe performance over time
* Highlight cards for high-level KPIs including total orders, total profit, and average order value
* Top-selling and least-performing products and regions for deeper operational analysis
* Clean, responsive layout for intuitive exploration and decision-making

Tools and Technologies Used

* Power BI Desktop for dashboard development and DAX for measures and calculated fields
* Excel for preliminary data cleaning and formatting
* Data modeling to manage relationships and data hierarchies efficiently

How to View

Open the `.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop to explore the dashboard interactively. Users can click on segments, apply filters, and drill down into specific categories or time frames to explore performance insights. No coding knowledge required to navigate.
